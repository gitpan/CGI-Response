		       CHANGES TO CGI::RESPONSE
		       ------------------------

Version 0.02:
	(24 November 1995) SelfLoader + update
	    + Added support for SelfLoader, which results in almost a
	      four-times speed increase for Simple Interface applications.
	    + Corrected some method calls to LWP::* modules for
	      compatability with version 0.6 of that release.
	    + Added the bare beginnings of a pod (documentation).
	    + Added in some of the trappings of a real release -- a
	      README file, this CHANGES files, a TO-DO list, and a
	      tarfile distribution.
	    + Added a Makefile.PL and MANIFEST file for MakeMaker
	      support.  
	    + I made a valiant effort to to include some tests, but 
	      SelfLoader seems to really screw with -w warnings, so
	      the tests keep failing.  Maybe next release.  For the
	      time being, I've removed the internal self-test from the
	      main Response.pm file.

Version 0.011:
	(14 August 1995) Maintenance release 
	    + Corrected some 'use' statements to account for new
	      LWP::* release.

Version 0.01: 
	(08 August 1995) First release 
	    + Defined most header values.  
	    + Proposed an interface for 'Simple' or 'Full' applications.
	    +
